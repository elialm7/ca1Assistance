This was my first serious project i've ever made.
this software made using java 8. to track the student attendance.
the requirements were: 
  1- being able to control/register all the clases in each block
  2- being able to control/register all the teachers in their schedule. 
  3- all the data recorded in one database. 
  4- each watchman must have installed in their computers to record the daily data. 
  
 the first approach i had was to create a website within an intranet in the school, a central server and  a database, the schoold had the infrastructure but i wasn't allowed to use it. 
 so i decided to build a program with java(the only language i knew pretty well back then), with all the interface to register and record the data from "users".
 it worked pretty well, but it could have been better. I was a student from that school situated in my country. It was my last year there so we had to show some project about programming, etc.
